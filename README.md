## Monitoring Metrics for WordPress, Apache, and Nginx

Monitoring your WordPress application along with the underlying web server (Apache or Nginx) is crucial for maintaining performance, reliability, and availability. This document outlines the essential metrics to monitor for each component:

### 1. WordPress Metrics

WordPress is a dynamic PHP-based content management system (CMS) that runs on a web server and interacts heavily with a database. Monitoring WordPress involves both application-specific and server-level metrics:

#### Application Metrics:
- **Response Time:** Average time taken to respond to HTTP requests.
- **Throughput:** Number of HTTP requests handled per second, indicating traffic load.
- **Error Rate:** Percentage of HTTP requests that result in errors (e.g., 4xx, 5xx), indicating application stability.
- **Database Queries:** Number of SQL queries executed per second, reflecting database load.
- **Memory Usage:** Memory consumed by PHP processes running WordPress, crucial for server capacity planning.

#### Server Metrics:
- **CPU Utilization:** Percentage of CPU capacity used by the server, impacting application performance.
- **Memory Utilization:** RAM used by the server to host WordPress, affecting overall system stability.
- **Disk I/O:** Read/write operations on the server’s disk, affecting storage performance.
- **Network Traffic:** Inbound and outbound data transfer rate, indicating network utilization.

### 2. Apache HTTP Server Metrics

Apache HTTP Server, a widely used web server, serves WordPress and other web applications. Monitoring Apache includes both server-specific and HTTP-related metrics:

#### HTTP Server Metrics:
- **Total Requests:** Total number of HTTP requests processed by Apache, indicating server load.
- **Request Rate:** Rate of HTTP requests per second, indicating traffic intensity.
- **Bytes Sent/Received:** Amount of data transferred (sent/received) by Apache, impacting network performance.
- **Connection Count:** Number of active connections to Apache, affecting concurrent user capacity.
- **Workers:** Number of Apache worker processes or threads active, affecting request handling capacity.

#### System Metrics:
- **CPU Utilization:** CPU usage by Apache processes, affecting overall server performance.
- **Memory Usage:** RAM consumed by Apache processes, influencing server stability.
- **Disk I/O:** Read/write operations involving Apache’s files or logs, affecting disk performance.

### 3. Nginx HTTP Server Metrics

Nginx, known for its high performance and scalability, is another popular web server choice. Monitoring Nginx involves capturing critical server and HTTP-related metrics:

#### HTTP Server Metrics:
- **Active Connections:** Number of active client connections being handled by Nginx, indicating current workload.
- **Requests:** Total number of requests processed by Nginx, reflecting overall server usage.
- **Request Rate:** Rate of requests per second handled by Nginx, indicating traffic intensity.
- **Response Time:** Average time taken to respond to requests, crucial for user experience.
- **5xx Errors:** Number of server errors (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error), indicating issues requiring immediate attention.

#### System Metrics:
- **CPU Utilization:** CPU usage by Nginx worker processes, affecting server performance.
- **Memory Usage:** RAM consumed by Nginx processes, impacting server stability.
- **Disk I/O:** Read/write operations involving Nginx’s files or logs, affecting disk performance.
- **Network Traffic:** Inbound and outbound data transfer rate handled by Nginx, indicating network utilization.

### Conclusion

Effective monitoring of WordPress, Apache HTTP Server, and Nginx ensures proactive management of your web application infrastructure. By monitoring these metrics, you can identify performance bottlenecks, anticipate resource requirements, and ensure optimal user experience. Customize these metrics based on your specific environment and monitoring tools to achieve comprehensive visibility and proactive management.

Certainly! Here are the few main commands used in this project:

1. **Docker Commands**:
   - `docker build -t shreyabansal/nginx-lua .`: Build a Docker image named `shreyabansal/nginx-lua`.
   - `docker push shreyabansal/nginx-lua`: Push the Docker image to a Docker registry.

2. **Kubernetes Commands**:
   - `kubectl create namespace <namespace-name>`: Create a new Kubernetes namespace.
   - `kubectl create -f wordpress.yaml`: Deploy a Kubernetes resource from a YAML file (`wordpress.yaml`).
   - `kubectl get pods`: List all Kubernetes pods in the current namespace.
   - `kubectl get svc`: List all Kubernetes services in the current namespace.
   - `kubectl apply -f prometheus-ingress.yaml`: Apply a Kubernetes resource from a YAML file (`prometheus-ingress.yaml`).

3. **Helm Commands**:
   - `helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts`: Add a Helm repository for Grafana.
   - `helm repo update`: Update Helm repositories.
   - `helm install grafana grafana/grafana`: Install Grafana using Helm.

4. **Prometheus and Grafana Configuration**:
   - `kubectl port-forward <grafana-pod-name> 3000:3000 --namespace=<namespace>`: Port-forward Grafana to access it locally.
   - `kubectl get secret --namespace <namespace> grafana -o jsonpath="{.data.admin-password}" | base64 --decode`: Retrieve Grafana admin password.
   - Access Grafana at `http://localhost:3000` and Prometheus at `http://localhost:9090` after port-forwarding.
   
5. **Monitoring and Metrics Configuration**:
   - Created ServiceMonitors and Ingress resources (`ServiceMonitor`, `Ingress`) for Prometheus and Grafana.
   - Configured alerts and dashboards in Grafana for monitoring Kubernetes resources, application metrics, and server metrics.
   - Used YAML files (`prometheus-config.yaml`, `prometheus-ingress.yaml`, etc.) to define Prometheus and Grafana configurations.

These commands cover the essential operations performed in the project, including Docker image management, Kubernetes deployment and management, Helm chart operations, and configuration of monitoring and metrics components using Prometheus and Grafana. 
Adjust the specific parameters and names (`<namespace>`, `<grafana-pod-name>`, etc.) based on your actual environment and resource names.
